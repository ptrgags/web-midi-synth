# Web MIDI Synth

For a music theory class, I realized it would be helpful to have a way to
plug in my MIDI synthesizer and just start playing without messing
with settings. Once I learned about p5.sound.js, I realized this would be
easy to implement.

This is an early draft so all it has is a table of square wave oscillators
with no filters or anything. I will likely add more controls
and some visualization options too.
